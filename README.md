# Introduction
This repository contains the projects I did for the Data Analytics Nanodegree at Udacity. The program was sponsored by ALX-T.

# Project 001
I analyzed, visualized and report my findings on the No Show Appointments. 
This dataset contains over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil regarding if a patient showed up or not to the medical appointment.

# Project 002
I gathered, wrangled and analyzed over 5000+ tweets from WeRateDogs twitter profile.

# Project 003
I used exploratory and explanatory visualizations based on the data available from the Ford Gobike share program in the San Francisco area to showcase: 
- How the trips were spread out geographically
- How gender, age and even membership can affect ride duration
- How the trips were distributed across the month and day
